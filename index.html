        Hey, I’m Yashveer Singh Rajpoot—18 years old, fueled by caffeine, curiosity,
        and the questionable life choice of juggling web development, graphic design,
        content writing, and Python tutoring all at once.
        <br><br>
        I build websites that load faster than your Wi-Fi decides to disappoint you.
        Clean code, smooth UI, and zero drama—because there’s enough of that in real life already.

<article style="margin-bottom:18px">
<h3>Breka Bakery & Café</h3>
<p class="bio">Breka isn’t just a bakery. It’s the kind of place where mornings sneak up on you with a croissant in one hand and a latte in the other, and suddenly life doesn’t feel so complicated. I built their digital presence with the same kind of precision I use when I decide whether to save someone or leave them to their chaos. Every pixel, every hover effect, every image of a pastry was chosen to make you pause, maybe drool a little, and feel like this café has been your secret obsession all along. The site tells the story of warmth and indulgence, of aroma and anticipation, but it also whispers something a little darker—the kind of sophistication you don’t expect from a bakery. It’s not just bread; it’s attention to detail, patience, and style baked right in. I wanted users to linger, to scroll just a little longer, to realize that a place this beautiful online probably tastes even better offline. And if they don’t—well, that’s their loss, but they’ll remember it, because Breka doesn’t let go easily.</p>

<article style="margin-bottom:18px">
<h3>Hotel Sacher</h3>
<p class="bio">Some places are legendary. Some places are whispered about over champagne and chocolate torte. Hotel Sacher is one of those places. Translating that aura into a digital experience wasn’t about showing off; it was about letting the elegance speak for itself. I built a website that oozes understated luxury, where every photo, every navigation element, and every text block feels like velvet brushing against your senses. Booking a stay isn’t just clicking a button; it’s an invitation into a world where history meets modern indulgence, and where the past winks at you while you sip your coffee. I wanted visitors to feel the charm, the mystery, and the kind of confidence that comes from knowing you’re in a place that has seen empires rise and fall but still serves the perfect dessert. This wasn’t just a website; it was storytelling with code, a digital portal to a timeless experience that leaves you both awed and slightly envious of the people who already call it home.</p>

<article style="margin-bottom:18px">
<h3>Astrotalk Store</h3>
<p class="bio">Astrotalk is more than gemstones, Rudraksha, and spiritual jewelry. It’s an experience, a nudge from the universe saying maybe, just maybe, you’re about to discover something extraordinary. Crafting their website was like curating a constellation—you place each element where it shines, creating connections that feel inevitable. I made sure the visuals felt like magic without being cheesy, like you stumbled into a treasure chest and the stars themselves were winking at you. Users can explore, shop, and get a sense of destiny while still knowing exactly what they’re buying. It’s playful, intriguing, and a little dangerous—the kind of allure that makes you come back and see what else the universe might have in store.</p>

<h3>Solastaa</h3>
<p class="bio">Solastaa isn’t a salon. It’s a playground for confidence, creativity, and the kind of beauty that doesn’t need permission. Designing their digital home meant capturing every subtlety—the glow of a facial, the sheen of a fresh hair color, the delicate artistry of nails done right. Every scroll tells a story of transformation, not just external but internal. I wanted visitors to feel pampered before they even book an appointment, to sense the mischief in making a small change that suddenly changes everything. It’s sophisticated yet playful, professional yet magnetic, a little mysterious, and undeniably stylish. Solastaa’s website isn’t just a place to book services; it’s a portal into a world where beauty meets personality, and every interaction feels like it was designed just for you.</p>
